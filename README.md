## Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Drago-03/Neural-Nexus.git
   cd Neural-Nexus
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory using the `.env.local.example` as a template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```
   Then edit the file to add your actual credentials.

4. **Supabase Setup (Main Database & Auth)**:
   
   a. Create a Supabase project at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (free tier available)
   
   b. Get your API credentials:
      - Go to Project Settings > API
      - Copy the URL, public anon key, and service role key
      - Add them to your `.env.local` file
   
   c. Initialize the database:
      - After setting up your project and environment variables, run:
      ```bash
      # Start your Next.js dev server
      npm run dev
      
      # In a new terminal, initialize the database (one-time setup)
      curl "http://localhost:3000/api/supabase-setup?setup_key=YOUR_SETUP_KEY_FROM_ENV"
      ```
      
   d. Enable authentication providers:
      - Go to Authentication > Providers
      - Enable Email, Google, GitHub, etc. as needed
      - Configure OAuth credentials for third-party providers
      - For GitHub & Google OAuth, set the callback URL to: `https://your-supabase-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
      - For production, set your Redirect URL in provider settings to: `https://your-site-domain.com/auth/callback`
      
   e. Enable anonymous authentication:
      - Go to Authentication > Providers
      - Scroll down to "Anonymous Sign-in" and toggle it on
      - This allows users to try the platform without creating an account
   
   f. Set up storage buckets:
      - Go to Storage
      - Create buckets for: `models`, `avatars`, `thumbnails`
      - Set RLS policies for each bucket

5. **Firebase Setup (Legacy/Optional)**:
   
   The app is transitioning from Firebase to Supabase, but can still use Firebase for some features.
   
   a. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   
   b. Enable Authentication services:
      - Go to Authentication > Sign-in method
      - Enable Email/Password and Google sign-in methods
   
   c. Create a Firestore database:
      - Go to Firestore Database > Create database
      - Start in production mode
      - Choose a location close to your users
   
   d. Set up Storage:
      - Go to Storage > Get started
      - Set up security rules for production
   
   e. Get your Firebase config:
      - Go to Project settings > General
      - Scroll down to "Your apps" and select your web app
      - Copy the Firebase config values to your `.env.local` file

6. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Supabase Data Model

The application uses the following Supabase tables:

### **user_profiles**
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  first_name TEXT,
  last_name TEXT,
  display_name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  bio TEXT,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  website TEXT,
  social_links JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **models**
```sql
CREATE TABLE models (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price DECIMAL(10, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  category TEXT,
  tags TEXT[],
  file_url TEXT,
  file_path TEXT,
  file_size BIGINT,
  file_type TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  downloads INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  rating DECIMAL(3, 2) DEFAULT 0,
  is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'
);
```

## Deployment on Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and create a new project
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Set all the environment variables from your `.env.local` file in the Vercel dashboard
5. Deploy your application

### **Setting Up Environment Variables on Vercel**
- Go to your project settings in Vercel
- Navigate to Environment Variables
- Add all the variables from your `.env.local` file
- Make sure to set `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production`
- Redeploy your application to apply the changes

## Monitoring and Analytics

Both Supabase and Firebase provide tools to monitor your application:

1. **Supabase Dashboard**: Track database usage, API calls, and authentication
2. **Firebase Analytics** (if using): Track user engagement and app usage
3. **Vercel Analytics**: Monitor page performance and user metrics

## Edge Functions vs. Serverless Functions

This app uses both Edge Functions (for lightweight operations) and standard serverless functions (for heavier processing):

- **Edge Functions**: Fast, lightweight API routes that run globally close to users
- **Serverless Functions**: More powerful Node.js environments for database operations and complex processing

## Web3 Wallet Integration

Neural Nexus includes a lightweight wallet connection system through the `SimpleCryptoProvider`. This replaces the previous TonConnect implementation.

### **Enabling the Wallet Connection**

To enable wallet connection in your application:

1. Set the feature flag in your `.env.local` file:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SIMPLE_CRYPTO=true
```

2. The wallet connect button will automatically appear in the navbar when the feature flag is enabled.

3. For custom integration, you can use the `SimpleCryptoButton` component:
```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

// Import with dynamic to avoid SSR issues
const SimpleCryptoButton = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/SimpleCryptoButton'),
  { ssr: false }
);

// Then use it in your component
function MyComponent() {
  return <SimpleCryptoButton />;
}
```

4. For direct access to wallet state, use the `useSimpleCrypto` hook:
```tsx
import { useSimpleCrypto } from '@/providers/SimpleCryptoProvider';

function MyComponent() {
  const { activeWallet, connectWallet, disconnectWallet } = useSimpleCrypto();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {activeWallet ? (
        <div>Connected to: {activeWallet}</div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => connectWallet('MetaMask')}>Connect</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
