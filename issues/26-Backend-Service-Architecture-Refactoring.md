# Issue: Refactor Backend Service Architecture for Scalability

**Tags:** `backend`, `architecture`, `scalability`, `high-priority`, `refactoring`

## Description

The current monolithic backend architecture has scalability limitations, making it difficult to handle increasing load and maintain clear separation of concerns. We need to refactor the backend service architecture to a more modular, scalable approach that supports independent scaling and deployment of components.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Monolithic backend architecture limiting scalability
- Poor separation of concerns between different service domains
- Inefficient resource utilization during peak loads
- Tight coupling between components making changes risky
- Difficulty in implementing different scaling needs for different services
- Single point of failure risks in the current architecture
- High cognitive load for developers working across the entire codebase
- Performance bottlenecks affecting the entire system
- Deployment dependencies between unrelated features
- Limited ability to use different technologies for different components

## Proposed Solution

Implement a service-oriented architecture that:
- Decomposes the monolith into logical, domain-driven services
- Creates clear boundaries between different service domains
- Enables independent scaling of different components
- Reduces coupling through well-defined interfaces
- Supports different scaling strategies for different services
- Eliminates single points of failure through redundancy
- Reduces cognitive load by domain-specific boundaries
- Addresses performance bottlenecks with targeted scaling
- Enables independent deployment of services
- Allows appropriate technology choices for each service

## Implementation Requirements

- Conduct domain-driven design analysis of the current system
- Define service boundaries and interfaces
- Create migration strategy from monolith to services
- Implement service communication patterns (REST, GraphQL, messaging)
- Set up independent deployment pipelines for each service
- Create service discovery and registration mechanism
- Implement circuit breakers and fallback strategies
- Develop comprehensive monitoring for the service ecosystem
- Create documentation for service boundaries and responsibilities
- Implement automated testing for service interactions

## Acceptance Criteria

- Backend is decomposed into logical, independently deployable services
- Each service has well-defined boundaries and interfaces
- Services can be scaled independently based on demand
- Service interactions are resilient to failures
- Overall system performance improves under load
- Deployment of one service doesn't require changes to others
- Monitoring provides clear visibility into service health
- Documentation clearly explains service responsibilities
- Tests verify correct service interactions
- System maintains or improves current functionality

## Additional Notes

This refactoring should be done incrementally to minimize disruption, with careful planning of each step. Consider using the strangler pattern to gradually migrate functionality from the monolith to new services. The first candidates for extraction should be services with the most distinct scaling needs or those with the clearest boundaries.
