# Issue: Implement API Client SDK Generation

**Tags:** `developer-experience`, `api`, `frontend`, `medium-priority`, `tooling`

## Description

Currently, developers integrating with our API need to write their own client code, which increases integration time and the potential for errors. We need an automated SDK generation system that provides language-specific client libraries for our API.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No official client libraries for popular programming languages
- Developers must write custom integration code
- Inconsistent handling of authentication across client implementations
- No type definitions for API requests and responses
- API changes require manual updates to client code
- Missing convenience methods for common operations
- No standardized error handling in client implementations
- Limited examples of client usage

## Proposed Solution

Implement an SDK generation system that:
- Creates client libraries for popular programming languages
- Provides strong typing for requests and responses
- Handles authentication automatically
- Updates in sync with API changes
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Offers convenience methods for common operations
- Contains detailed usage examples

## Implementation Requirements

- Choose an OpenAPI/Swagger specification approach
- Create and maintain accurate API specifications
- Set up an automated SDK generation pipeline
- Implement SDK generation for key languages (JavaScript, Python, etc.)
- Create a versioning strategy for SDKs
- Add comprehensive documentation and examples
- Establish an SDK testing framework
- Create a release process for SDK updates

## Acceptance Criteria

- SDK libraries are available for at least 3 major programming languages
- SDKs provide strong typing for all API operations
- Authentication is handled automatically
- SDKs update when the API changes
- Error handling is consistent and comprehensive
- SDK documentation includes clear usage examples
- SDKs follow language-specific best practices
- Testing framework verifies SDK functionality

## Additional Notes

The SDK generation should be tightly integrated with the API documentation and versioning strategies. Consider using tools like OpenAPI Generator or similar to automate the process as much as possible.
