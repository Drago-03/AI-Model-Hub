# Issue: Implement API Integration Testing Framework

**Tags:** `testing`, `quality-assurance`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`

## Description

The API currently lacks a comprehensive integration testing framework, making it difficult to ensure reliability and catch regressions. We need to implement a robust testing strategy that verifies API behavior across endpoints and use cases.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Limited automated testing of API endpoints
- No standardized approach to API integration testing
- Missing test coverage for complex workflows
- Difficult to verify cross-endpoint functionality
- No automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Missing performance testing for API endpoints
- No contract testing between frontend and API
- Limited testing of error conditions and edge cases

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API integration testing framework that:
- Tests all API endpoints and their interactions
- Verifies functionality across complex workflows
- Runs automatically in CI/CD pipelines
- Includes performance testing
- Implements contract testing
- Covers error conditions and edge cases
- Provides clear reporting of test results

## Implementation Requirements

- Choose a testing framework and tools
- Create a test environment with isolated data
- Implement tests for all API endpoints
- Add workflow tests for complex user journeys
- Create performance tests for critical endpoints
- Implement contract testing between frontend and API
- Set up automated test runs in CI/CD
- Create reporting and dashboards for test results

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints have integration tests
- Complex workflows are verified through tests
- Tests run automatically on code changes
- Performance is verified against baseline metrics
- Contract tests ensure frontend compatibility
- Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- Test results are clearly reported
- Test coverage meets defined thresholds

## Additional Notes

The testing framework should balance comprehensive coverage with execution speed. Consider implementing a combination of focused unit tests and broader integration tests to achieve good coverage without excessive run times.
