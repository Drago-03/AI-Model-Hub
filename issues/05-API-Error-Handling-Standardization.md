# Issue: Standardize API Error Handling

**Tags:** `developer-experience`, `api`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `refactoring`

## Description

The current API error handling is inconsistent across endpoints, with varying error formats, status codes, and error details. We need a standardized approach to API error responses that provides clear, actionable information to API consumers.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent error response formats across different endpoints
- Incorrect or missing HTTP status codes
- Vague error messages that don't provide actionable information
- Missing error codes for programmatic handling
- Inconsistent field names in error responses
- No standard approach for validation errors
- Missing stack traces in development environments
- Insufficient logging of API errors

## Proposed Solution

Implement a standardized error handling system with:
- Consistent error response format across all endpoints
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Clear, actionable error messages
- Unique error codes for programmatic handling
- Detailed validation errors
- Environment-specific error details
- Comprehensive error logging

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a centralized error handling middleware
- Define a standard error response schema
- Implement consistent HTTP status code usage
- Create a system of error codes
- Add detailed validation error formatting
- Implement environment-specific error details
- Update all API endpoints to use the standardized error handling
- Document the error handling approach in API documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints return errors in a consistent format
- HTTP status codes are used appropriately
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- Error responses include unique error codes
- Validation errors provide field-specific details
- Development environments receive additional debug information
- Error handling approach is well-documented
- Errors are properly logged for monitoring

## Additional Notes

The standardized error format should follow industry best practices (consider using RFC 7807 Problem Details for HTTP APIs) while being pragmatic about implementation. The goal is to make API errors as helpful as possible for developers integrating with our API.
