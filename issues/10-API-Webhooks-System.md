# Issue: Implement Comprehensive API Webhooks System

**Tags:** `feature-request`, `integration`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`

## Description

The platform currently lacks a comprehensive webhooks system, limiting integration capabilities for users who want real-time notifications of events. We need to implement a robust webhooks system that allows users to receive notifications for various platform events.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No standardized webhooks system for notifying external systems
- Missing critical event notifications (model updates, API key changes, etc.)
- No webhook management UI
- Missing webhook security features (signing, authentication)
- No retry mechanism for failed webhook deliveries
- Missing webhook delivery logs and debugging tools
- No rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Limited documentation on webhook integration

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive webhooks system that:
- Supports notifications for all key platform events
- Includes a user-friendly webhook management UI
- Implements security best practices
- Provides reliable delivery with retries
- Offers detailed logs and debugging tools
- Includes appropriate rate limiting
- Is well-documented for developers

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a centralized webhook dispatch service
- Define standard event types and payload formats
- Implement webhook signature verification
- Add webhook management UI in dashboard
- Create a retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Implement webhook delivery logging
- Add rate limiting for webhook endpoints
- Document webhook integration process
- Create webhook subscription validation

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can subscribe to webhook notifications for key events
- Webhook management UI allows easy configuration
- Webhook payloads are signed for security
- Failed webhook deliveries are retried with appropriate backoff
- Webhook delivery history is available for debugging
- Rate limits prevent webhook abuse
- Documentation clearly explains webhook integration
- Webhook subscriptions are validated before activation

## Additional Notes

The webhooks system should follow industry best practices for delivery, security, and payload formatting. Consider implementing a webhook testing tool that allows users to verify their endpoint configuration before going live.
