# Issue: Implement API Caching Strategy

**Tags:** `performance`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`, `optimization`

## Description

The API currently lacks a standardized caching strategy, leading to unnecessary load on backend services and slower response times for clients. We need a comprehensive caching approach that improves performance while ensuring data consistency.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No consistent caching headers across API endpoints
- Missing ETags for efficient client-side caching
- Unnecessary recomputation of unchanged resources
- No server-side caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Inconsistent cache invalidation strategies
- Missing cache control directives in responses
- No consideration for cache warming on critical endpoints
- Lack of cache analytics and monitoring

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API caching strategy that:
- Uses appropriate cache headers for all responses
- Implements ETags for conditional requests
- Adds a server-side caching layer
- Establishes clear cache invalidation patterns
- Supports cache warming for critical endpoints
- Includes cache monitoring and analytics

## Implementation Requirements

- Define caching policies for different resource types
- Implement standard cache headers (Cache-Control, ETag, etc.)
- Add support for conditional requests (If-None-Match, If-Modified-Since)
- Create a server-side caching layer (Redis, Memcached, etc.)
- Implement cache invalidation mechanisms
- Add cache warming for critical endpoints
- Create a cache monitoring dashboard
- Document caching behavior in API documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints include appropriate cache headers
- ETags enable efficient conditional requests
- Server-side caching reduces database load
- Cache invalidation works correctly when data changes
- Cache hit rate meets target metrics
- Critical endpoints benefit from cache warming
- Caching behavior is well-documented
- Cache performance is monitored and optimized

## Additional Notes

The caching strategy should be tailored to the specific needs of different endpoints, with varying TTLs based on data volatility. Consider implementing a cache abstraction layer that allows for different caching backends depending on deployment environment.
