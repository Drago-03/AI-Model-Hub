# Issue: Implement Robust API Rate Limiting System

**Tags:** `security`, `performance`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`

## Description

The current API rate limiting system is inconsistent across endpoints and lacks proper configuration options based on user tiers. We need a standardized rate limiting approach that protects our services while providing appropriate access levels.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent rate limiting across different API endpoints
- No tier-based rate limiting based on user subscription level
- Missing header information about rate limit status
- No burst handling for legitimate traffic spikes
- Poor logging of rate limit violations
- Insufficient monitoring of rate limit events
- No graceful degradation when approaching limits

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive rate limiting system with:
- Consistent rate limiting across all API endpoints
- Tier-based limits based on user subscription level
- Standard rate limit headers in responses
- Token bucket algorithm for handling traffic bursts
- Detailed logging and monitoring
- Graceful degradation options

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a centralized rate limiting middleware/service
- Implement configurable limits based on user tiers
- Add proper response headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, etc.)
- Create a monitoring dashboard for rate limit events
- Implement alerts for suspicious rate limit patterns
- Document rate limits in API documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints have consistent rate limiting
- Different user tiers have appropriate rate limits
- Rate limit information is returned in response headers
- Burst traffic is handled appropriately
- Rate limit events are properly logged and monitored
- Documentation clearly explains rate limit policies
- System gracefully handles approaching rate limits

## Additional Notes

This system should balance security with user experience, ensuring that legitimate users aren't unnecessarily restricted while protecting our infrastructure from abuse.
