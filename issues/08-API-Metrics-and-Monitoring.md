# Issue: Enhance API Metrics and Monitoring System

**Tags:** `devops`, `observability`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`

## Description

The current API lacks comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring, making it difficult to track performance, usage patterns, and potential issues. We need a robust metrics and monitoring system that provides actionable insights into API health and usage.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Limited visibility into API performance metrics
- No comprehensive request/response timing data
- Missing endpoint-specific usage statistics
- Insufficient error rate monitoring
- No alerting system for API issues
- Limited dashboards for visualizing API health
- No user-specific usage analytics
- Missing tracing for request flows across services

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API metrics and monitoring system that:
- Collects detailed performance metrics for all endpoints
- Tracks usage patterns and trends
- Monitors error rates and types
- Provides alerting for critical issues
- Offers detailed dashboards for visualization
- Supports distributed tracing
- Enables user-specific analytics

## Implementation Requirements

- Implement middleware for metrics collection
- Choose and set up a monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
- Create custom metrics for API-specific concerns
- Implement distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry, Jaeger, etc.)
- Set up alerting rules and notification channels
- Create dashboards for different stakeholders
- Implement user-specific usage tracking
- Document the monitoring approach

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints have performance metrics
- Latency, error rates, and throughput are tracked
- Usage patterns can be visualized and analyzed
- Alerts trigger on predefined thresholds
- Dashboards provide clear visibility into API health
- Distributed tracing tracks request flows
- User-specific usage can be monitored
- Metrics retention policies meet compliance requirements

## Additional Notes

The monitoring system should balance comprehensive data collection with performance impact. Consider implementing sampling strategies for high-volume endpoints while ensuring critical metrics are always captured.
