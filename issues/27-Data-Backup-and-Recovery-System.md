# Issue: Implement Comprehensive Data Backup and Recovery System

**Tags:** `backend`, `database`, `devops`, `high-priority`, `reliability`

## Description

The current system lacks a robust data backup and recovery strategy, putting user data at risk in case of system failures, accidental deletions, or security incidents. We need to implement a comprehensive backup and recovery system to ensure data integrity, availability, and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No automated regular backup schedule
- Missing point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Incomplete backup coverage across different data stores
- No verification process for backup integrity
- Lack of documented recovery procedures
- Missing backup retention policies
- No testing of recovery procedures
- Insufficient security for backup storage
- Lack of monitoring for backup operations
- No compliance documentation for data protection requirements

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive data backup and recovery system that:
- Automates regular backups on appropriate schedules
- Provides point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Covers all data stores (SQL, NoSQL, file storage)
- Verifies backup integrity automatically
- Documents clear recovery procedures
- Implements appropriate retention policies
- Regularly tests recovery procedures
- Secures backup storage appropriately
- Monitors backup operations with alerting
- Maintains compliance documentation

## Implementation Requirements

- Design backup strategy with appropriate schedules and methods
- Implement automated backup system for all data stores
- Create point-in-time recovery capability
- Develop backup verification processes
- Document detailed recovery procedures
- Define and implement retention policies
- Create schedule for regular recovery testing
- Implement secure backup storage with encryption
- Set up monitoring and alerting for backup operations
- Create compliance documentation for data protection

## Acceptance Criteria

- All critical data is automatically backed up on appropriate schedules
- Point-in-time recovery is available for at least 30 days
- All data stores are included in backup coverage
- Backup integrity is automatically verified after each backup
- Recovery procedures are documented and accessible to operations team
- Retention policies comply with business and regulatory requirements
- Recovery procedures are successfully tested quarterly
- Backup storage meets security requirements including encryption
- Monitoring alerts on backup failures or anomalies
- Compliance documentation satisfies regulatory requirements

## Additional Notes

This system should be implemented with a focus on automation and reliability, minimizing manual intervention in routine backup operations. Consider implementing different backup strategies (full, incremental, differential) based on data criticality and change frequency. Ensure that the backup system itself has redundancy to avoid single points of failure.
