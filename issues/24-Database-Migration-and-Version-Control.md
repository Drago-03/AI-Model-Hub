# Issue: Implement Database Migration and Version Control System

**Tags:** `database`, `backend`, `devops`, `high-priority`, `infrastructure`

## Description

The current database management lacks a formal migration system, making schema changes risky and difficult to coordinate across environments. We need a robust database migration and version control system to safely evolve our database schema, track changes, and ensure consistency across all environments.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No formalized database migration process
- Schema changes applied manually and inconsistently across environments
- No version control for database schema changes
- Difficult to roll back problematic database changes
- Development and production environments often have schema inconsistencies
- No automated validation of migrations before deployment
- Missing documentation of schema changes and reasoning
- Inefficient coordination of database changes among team members
- No integration of database migrations with CI/CD pipeline
- Risk of data loss during schema changes

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive database migration system that:
- Formalizes the process for all database schema changes
- Tracks all schema modifications in version control
- Ensures consistent application across all environments
- Provides reliable rollback capabilities
- Validates migrations before deployment
- Documents all schema changes with reasoning
- Integrates with the CI/CD pipeline
- Minimizes risk of data loss during migrations
- Improves team coordination for database changes
- Supports both SQL and NoSQL database systems

## Implementation Requirements

- Select and implement a database migration framework
- Create standardized migration templates
- Integrate migration system with version control
- Implement automated testing for migrations
- Add migration validation in CI/CD pipeline
- Create rollback procedures for all migrations
- Develop documentation standards for schema changes
- Set up database schema versioning system
- Train team on migration process and best practices
- Implement database state comparison tools

## Acceptance Criteria

- All database schema changes follow the migration process
- Migrations are tracked in version control with the application code
- All environments have consistent database schemas
- Migrations can be reliably rolled back when necessary
- All migrations are automatically tested before deployment
- Database changes are well-documented with business reasoning
- CI/CD pipeline includes database migration steps
- Zero data loss incidents during schema migrations
- Development team successfully follows the migration process
- Both SQL and NoSQL databases are supported by the system

## Additional Notes

Start with a comprehensive audit of the current database schema and existing inconsistencies between environments. Consider implementing this system first on non-production databases to gain experience before applying to production. This initiative should be closely coordinated with the database optimization issue (#17) to ensure complementary approaches.
