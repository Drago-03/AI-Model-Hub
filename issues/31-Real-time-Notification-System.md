# Issue: Implement Real-time Notification System

**Tags:** `feature`, `frontend`, `backend`, `websockets`, `medium-priority`

## Description

Users currently lack immediate awareness of important events and updates within the application. We need to implement a comprehensive real-time notification system that alerts users to relevant events, keeps them engaged, and improves overall user experience through timely information delivery.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No real-time notification mechanism exists
- Users must manually refresh to see updates
- Important events can be missed by users
- Email notifications are the only current alert method
- No notification preference management for users
- No way to track if notifications were viewed
- Lack of in-app notification history
- No support for push notifications on mobile devices
- Missing notification categorization and priority levels
- No offline notification queueing

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive real-time notification system that:
- Delivers instant in-app notifications for relevant events
- Supports multiple notification channels (in-app, email, push)
- Allows users to manage notification preferences
- Tracks notification read/unread status
- Maintains notification history for later reference
- Categorizes notifications by type and priority
- Queues notifications for offline users
- Supports rich content in notifications (text, images, actions)
- Provides a notification center UI component
- Scales to handle high notification volumes

## Implementation Requirements

- Set up WebSocket or SSE infrastructure for real-time communication
- Develop a notification service in the backend
- Create a notification database schema
- Implement a notification center UI component
- Develop notification preference management UI
- Integrate with existing authentication system
- Implement push notification support for mobile
- Create notification read/unread tracking
- Develop notification history storage and retrieval
- Implement notification categorization and filtering

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users receive real-time notifications without page refresh
- Notifications appear within 1 second of the triggering event
- Users can configure which notifications they receive
- Notification read/unread status is accurately tracked
- Users can access notification history for at least 30 days
- Notifications are properly categorized and filterable
- Push notifications work on supported mobile devices
- System handles at least 100 notifications per second
- Offline users receive queued notifications when they return
- UI components for notifications are accessible and responsive

## Additional Notes

Consider using Socket.io or Firebase Cloud Messaging for the real-time infrastructure. The notification system should be designed with scalability in mind, potentially using a message queue architecture. Privacy considerations should be paramount - ensure notifications don't leak sensitive information. Design the system to be extensible for future notification types.
