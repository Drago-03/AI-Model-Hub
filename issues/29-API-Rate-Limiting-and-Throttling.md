# Issue: Implement API Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Tags:** `backend`, `security`, `api`, `performance`, `medium-priority`

## Description

Our API currently lacks protection against excessive usage, making it vulnerable to abuse, DoS attacks, and resource exhaustion. We need to implement a robust rate limiting and throttling system to ensure fair usage, protect server resources, and maintain service availability for all users.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No limits on API request frequency from individual clients
- Vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks through excessive requests
- High-volume automated scrapers can consume disproportionate resources
- No differentiation between essential and non-essential API endpoints
- Lack of usage tiers for different user types
- Missing retry-after headers and proper status code responses
- No monitoring of API usage patterns
- Difficulty identifying abusive clients
- Risk of unexpected bill increases from cloud service providers due to traffic spikes

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API rate limiting and throttling system that:
- Limits request frequency based on client identity
- Provides graduated response to excessive requests
- Differentiates limits based on endpoint criticality
- Supports different rate limits for various user tiers
- Returns appropriate status codes and headers
- Logs and monitors usage patterns
- Identifies potential abuse
- Protects against resource exhaustion and cost spikes

## Implementation Requirements

- Design and implement token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm for rate limiting
- Create configuration for different rate limits by endpoint and user tier
- Implement client identification mechanism (API keys, IP, user ID)
- Return proper 429 Too Many Requests responses with Retry-After headers
- Add request throttling for expensive operations
- Set up monitoring and alerting for rate limit events
- Create admin dashboard for viewing API usage patterns
- Implement automatic temporary bans for repeated abuse
- Document rate limits in API documentation
- Develop graceful degradation of service under heavy load

## Acceptance Criteria

- Rate limits are enforced consistently across all API endpoints
- Different user tiers receive appropriate request allocations
- System properly identifies clients for rate limiting purposes
- 429 responses include clear Retry-After headers
- Rate limit events are logged and monitorable
- Admins can view usage patterns and rate limit events
- Documentation clearly explains rate limits to API consumers
- System can handle bursts of traffic without failing
- Abuse attempts are automatically detected and mitigated
- Rate limiting configuration can be updated without service restart

## Additional Notes

Consider implementing a Redis-based rate limiting solution for distributed environments. Rate limits should balance security needs with legitimate user experience. We should provide a clear upgrade path for users who regularly hit rate limits. The system should be flexible enough to adjust limits during special events or promotions.
