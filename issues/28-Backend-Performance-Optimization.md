# Issue: Implement Backend Performance Optimization

**Tags:** `backend`, `performance`, `optimization`, `high-priority`, `scalability`

## Description

The backend services are experiencing performance bottlenecks under increased load, resulting in slow response times and decreased user satisfaction. We need to implement comprehensive performance optimizations to improve throughput, reduce latency, and ensure the system can handle growing user demands.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Slow API response times during peak usage
- Inefficient database queries causing excessive load
- No query caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- Unoptimized background job processing
- Resource-intensive operations blocking request threads
- No performance benchmarking or profiling in place
- Memory leaks in long-running processes
- Missing connection pooling optimization
- Inefficient serialization/deserialization of large payloads
- No load testing to identify performance limits

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive backend performance optimization that:
- Improves API response times through targeted optimizations
- Optimizes database queries and indexes
- Implements appropriate caching strategies
- Moves resource-intensive operations to background processing
- Uses non-blocking I/O where appropriate
- Establishes performance benchmarking and profiling
- Addresses memory management issues
- Optimizes connection pooling
- Improves payload handling efficiency
- Implements regular load testing

## Implementation Requirements

- Profile backend services to identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical database queries and add missing indexes
- Implement caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Move resource-intensive operations to background jobs
- Convert blocking operations to use async/await patterns
- Set up performance monitoring and benchmarking tools
- Fix memory leaks in long-running processes
- Optimize connection pooling configuration
- Improve payload serialization/deserialization efficiency
- Implement regular load testing with realistic scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- API response times improved by at least 50% under load
- Database query times reduced to meet performance targets
- Caching reduces database load by at least 30% for common queries
- Resource-intensive operations don't block request handling
- Non-blocking I/O patterns used for external service calls
- Performance benchmarks established for all critical operations
- No memory leaks detected in 7-day continuous operation
- Connection pooling optimized to handle peak traffic
- Large payload handling optimized for efficiency
- System handles projected peak load with acceptable performance

## Additional Notes

Performance optimization should be data-driven, with metrics collected before and after changes to quantify improvements. Focus first on the most critical and frequently used endpoints. Consider implementing circuit breakers for external service dependencies to prevent cascading failures during high load.
