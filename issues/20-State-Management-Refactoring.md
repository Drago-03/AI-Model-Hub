# Issue: Refactor Frontend State Management Architecture

**Tags:** `frontend`, `architecture`, `performance`, `medium-priority`, `refactoring`

## Description

The current frontend state management approach is inconsistent, with a mix of different state management solutions (Context API, Redux, local state, etc.) leading to inefficient data flow, unnecessary re-renders, and difficult-to-maintain code. We need to refactor our state management to a more consistent and efficient architecture.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent state management approaches across the application
- Excessive prop drilling in many component hierarchies
- Unnecessary re-renders causing performance issues
- Duplicated state in multiple locations
- No clear strategy for local vs. global state
- Poor handling of asynchronous state updates
- Difficult to trace state changes and debug issues
- No optimistic UI updates for better user experience
- Inefficient data fetching and caching
- State persistence issues across page refreshes

## Proposed Solution

Implement a consistent state management architecture that:
- Standardizes the approach to state management
- Reduces unnecessary prop drilling
- Minimizes re-renders through proper memoization
- Eliminates duplicated state
- Clearly separates local and global state concerns
- Handles asynchronous state updates efficiently
- Makes state changes traceable and debuggable
- Supports optimistic UI updates
- Implements efficient data fetching and caching
- Properly persists state where needed

## Implementation Requirements

- Evaluate and select a consistent state management approach
- Create guidelines for when to use different state management techniques
- Refactor component hierarchies to reduce prop drilling
- Implement proper memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Consolidate duplicated state
- Create patterns for handling asynchronous state
- Add developer tools for state debugging
- Implement optimistic UI update patterns
- Add efficient data fetching and caching layer
- Create state persistence solution for critical state

## Acceptance Criteria

- Consistent state management approach across the application
- No excessive prop drilling in component hierarchies
- Minimal re-renders as measured by performance tools
- No duplicated state across the application
- Clear separation of local and global state
- Asynchronous state updates handled consistently
- State changes are traceable and debuggable
- User actions result in immediate UI feedback through optimistic updates
- Data fetching is efficient with proper caching
- Critical state persists across page refreshes

## Additional Notes

This refactoring should be done incrementally to minimize disruption. Consider using a hybrid approach during the transition period, and focus on high-impact areas first.
