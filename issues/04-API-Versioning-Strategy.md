# Issue: Implement API Versioning Strategy

**Tags:** `architecture`, `backend`, `medium-priority`, `api`, `developer-experience`

## Description

The API currently lacks a clear versioning strategy, which makes it difficult to evolve the API without breaking existing client integrations. We need a standardized approach to API versioning that allows us to make changes while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No consistent versioning in API endpoints
- Changes to endpoints risk breaking existing integrations
- Difficult to deprecate old functionality
- No mechanism to notify users of deprecated endpoints
- Missing support for version-specific documentation
- Inconsistent URL structures across the API
- No version negotiation in request/response headers

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API versioning strategy that:
- Establishes a clear version identifier in all API paths
- Provides backward compatibility guarantees
- Supports deprecation notices
- Includes version-specific documentation
- Follows RESTful best practices

## Implementation Requirements

- Choose a versioning strategy (URI path, query parameter, header)
- Refactor existing endpoints to include versioning
- Create a mechanism for handling deprecated endpoints
- Implement version-specific routing
- Update API documentation to reflect versioning
- Create guidelines for API changes across versions
- Develop a migration path for clients

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints include version information
- Changes to API behavior are version-specific
- Deprecated endpoints return appropriate warnings
- Documentation explains versioning policy and migration paths
- Testing framework verifies version-specific behavior
- Clients can request specific API versions
- Breaking changes are only introduced in new major versions

## Additional Notes

This versioning strategy should follow industry best practices while being pragmatic about implementation complexity. Consider using URI path versioning (e.g., /v1/resource) as it's the most explicit and widely adopted approach.
