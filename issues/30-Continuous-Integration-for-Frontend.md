# Issue: Implement Continuous Integration for Frontend

**Tags:** `devops`, `frontend`, `testing`, `high-priority`, `automation`

## Description

We need a robust continuous integration (CI) pipeline specifically for the frontend codebase to automate testing, linting, and build verification. This will help catch issues early, maintain code quality, and prevent problematic code from reaching production.

## Current Implementation Issues

- No automated testing runs on code commits
- Frontend build verification only happens manually
- Inconsistent code formatting and style across the codebase
- Bundle size monitoring not automated
- Accessibility testing performed inconsistently
- No automated visual regression testing
- Dependency vulnerabilities not automatically checked
- Performance metrics not tracked between builds
- No automated browser compatibility testing
- CI/CD pipeline focused primarily on backend with limited frontend support

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive frontend CI pipeline that:
- Automatically runs unit, integration, and e2e tests on each PR
- Verifies successful builds on multiple node versions
- Enforces code style and formatting rules
- Monitors bundle size changes
- Performs automated accessibility checks
- Conducts visual regression testing
- Scans for dependency vulnerabilities
- Tracks performance metrics between builds
- Tests on multiple browsers and viewports
- Integrates with the existing CI/CD workflow

## Implementation Requirements

- Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI solution for frontend workflow
- Configure Jest test runner for automated testing
- Implement ESLint/Prettier checks in the CI pipeline
- Set up bundle size monitoring with alerts for significant increases
- Configure automated accessibility testing with axe or similar
- Implement visual regression testing with tools like Percy or Chromatic
- Set up dependency scanning with tools like Dependabot
- Configure Lighthouse CI for performance tracking
- Set up cross-browser testing with BrowserStack or similar
- Integrate with existing deployment pipelines

## Acceptance Criteria

- All PRs automatically trigger the frontend CI pipeline
- Failed tests, linting, or builds block PR merges
- Code style is consistent across the codebase
- Bundle size increases beyond threshold require review
- Accessibility violations are automatically detected
- Visual regressions are caught before deployment
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies are flagged
- Performance regressions beyond threshold require review
- Frontend works correctly across supported browsers
- CI results are clearly visible in PR reviews

## Additional Notes

The CI pipeline should be optimized for speed to provide quick feedback to developers. Consider implementing caching strategies for node_modules and build artifacts. Create a clear dashboard for monitoring CI metrics over time. Document the pipeline thoroughly so new team members can understand how it works.
