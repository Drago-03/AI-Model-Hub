# Issue: Implement Comprehensive Accessibility Compliance

**Tags:** `accessibility`, `compliance`, `frontend`, `high-priority`, `user-experience`

## Description

The current website has numerous accessibility issues that prevent users with disabilities from effectively using the platform. We need a comprehensive accessibility overhaul to ensure compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provide an inclusive experience for all users.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Missing or inadequate ARIA attributes throughout the application
- Insufficient color contrast in multiple UI components
- Keyboard navigation is broken in many interactive elements
- Form inputs lack proper labels and error states
- No skip-to-content links for screen reader users
- Images missing alt text or have inadequate descriptions
- Modal dialogs not properly implemented for screen readers
- Focus management issues during dynamic content changes
- No support for reduced motion preferences
- Missing semantic HTML structure in many components

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive accessibility strategy that:
- Ensures proper ARIA attributes across all components
- Improves color contrast to meet WCAG AA standards
- Makes all functionality accessible via keyboard
- Implements proper form labeling and error handling
- Adds appropriate skip links and landmarks
- Ensures all images have meaningful alt text
- Correctly implements modal dialogs for screen readers
- Manages focus appropriately during content changes
- Respects user preferences for reduced motion
- Uses semantic HTML throughout the application

## Implementation Requirements

- Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit
- Create accessibility standards documentation
- Implement automated accessibility testing in CI/CD
- Fix critical accessibility issues in high-traffic pages
- Create accessible versions of all UI components
- Implement keyboard navigation throughout the application
- Add screen reader support for dynamic content
- Train development team on accessibility best practices
- Implement regular accessibility testing with real users

## Acceptance Criteria

- Website passes WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Color contrast meets minimum requirements throughout
- All images have appropriate alt text
- Form inputs are properly labeled and have accessible error states
- Screen readers correctly announce dynamic content changes
- Modal dialogs trap focus appropriately
- Motion animations respect user preferences
- Semantic HTML is used appropriately throughout
- Focus is managed correctly during navigation

## Additional Notes

Consider partnering with accessibility experts and conducting testing with users who rely on assistive technologies to ensure real-world accessibility beyond automated testing.
