**Tags:** `seo`, `frontend`, `medium-priority`, `marketing`

## Description

The current website lacks a comprehensive SEO strategy, with inconsistent metadata, missing structured data, and poor semantic HTML structure. This negatively impacts our search engine rankings and discoverability. We need to implement a robust SEO strategy to improve visibility and organic traffic.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent or missing page titles and meta descriptions
- No structured data (Schema.org) for key content types
- Poor semantic HTML structure affecting content hierarchy
- Missing OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata
- No XML sitemap or robots.txt configuration
- Inadequate handling of canonical URLs
- No implementation of breadcrumbs for improved navigation
- Missing alt text for many images
- No strategy for handling redirects and 404 errors
- Poor URL structure for content discoverability

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive SEO enhancement that:
- Standardizes metadata across all pages
- Adds appropriate structured data for rich snippets
- Improves semantic HTML structure
- Implements complete social sharing metadata
- Creates proper XML sitemap and robots.txt
- Handles canonical URLs correctly
- Implements breadcrumb navigation
- Ensures all images have descriptive alt text
- Creates a strategy for handling redirects and 404s
- Optimizes URL structure for discoverability

## Implementation Requirements

- Audit current SEO status and identify improvement opportunities
- Create metadata templates for different page types
- Implement structured data based on page content
- Refactor HTML to use appropriate semantic elements
- Add OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata
- Generate and maintain XML sitemap
- Create proper robots.txt with sitemap reference
- Add canonical URL handling
- Implement breadcrumb navigation
- Create a redirect strategy for changed URLs
- Optimize URL structure for content discoverability

## Acceptance Criteria

- All pages have appropriate title, description, and keyword metadata
- Structured data validates with no errors in Google's Structured Data Testing Tool
- HTML structure uses semantic elements appropriately
- Social sharing shows correct previews on major platforms
- XML sitemap includes all indexable pages and is automatically updated
- robots.txt correctly guides search engine crawlers
- Canonical URLs prevent duplicate content issues
- Breadcrumb navigation is available for all content pages
- All images have descriptive alt text
- 404 pages are handled gracefully with helpful navigation
- URL structure follows SEO best practices

## Additional Notes

This enhancement should be done in collaboration with marketing to ensure SEO strategy aligns with overall marketing goals. Consider implementing tools for ongoing SEO monitoring and improvement.
