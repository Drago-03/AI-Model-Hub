# Issue: Implement GraphQL API Layer

**Tags:** `feature-request`, `architecture`, `backend`, `high-priority`, `api`

## Description

The current REST API requires multiple requests for related data and often returns more data than needed. We should implement a GraphQL API layer to provide more flexible data fetching, reduce over-fetching, and improve the developer experience.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Multiple REST API calls required for related data
- Over-fetching of unnecessary fields in many endpoints
- Under-fetching requiring additional requests
- Inconsistent data shapes across related resources
- No real-time subscription capabilities
- Limited ability to tailor responses to specific client needs
- Increased frontend complexity to handle data aggregation
- No typed schema documentation

## Proposed Solution

Implement a GraphQL API layer that:
- Allows fetching multiple related resources in a single request
- Enables clients to specify exactly what data they need
- Provides a self-documenting schema
- Supports real-time subscriptions
- Coexists with the current REST API
- Offers improved developer experience

## Implementation Requirements

- Choose a GraphQL server implementation
- Design the GraphQL schema based on domain models
- Implement resolvers for all types and fields
- Create DataLoader patterns to prevent N+1 query problems
- Add authentication and authorization to the GraphQL layer
- Implement real-time subscriptions for key events
- Create comprehensive schema documentation
- Add monitoring and performance tracing

## Acceptance Criteria

- GraphQL endpoint provides access to all key resources
- Clients can fetch only the fields they need
- Related data can be retrieved in a single request
- Schema is self-documenting with descriptions
- Authentication works consistently with the REST API
- Performance is monitored and optimized
- N+1 query problems are prevented
- Real-time subscriptions work for specified events

## Additional Notes

The GraphQL implementation should focus on developer experience while maintaining security and performance. Consider implementing a phased approach, starting with read operations before adding mutations and subscriptions.
