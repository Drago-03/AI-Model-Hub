# Issue: Optimize Component Lazy Loading Strategy

**Tags:** `performance`, `frontend`, `optimization`, `high-priority`

## Description

The current lazy loading implementation for components is inconsistent across the application. Some heavy components are loaded eagerly, causing initial page load performance issues, while others use a basic implementation of lazy loading without proper loading states or error boundaries.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent use of lazy loading across components
- Missing loading states for many lazy-loaded components
- No standardized approach to component chunking
- 2-minute chunk loading timeout is excessive
- No retry mechanism for failed chunk loading
- Inefficient code splitting strategies
- Initial page loads include non-essential components
- No preloading of critical components

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive lazy loading strategy that:
- Standardizes the approach to component lazy loading
- Provides appropriate loading states and fallbacks
- Optimizes code splitting for better performance
- Implements intelligent preloading for critical paths
- Adds proper error handling for chunk loading failures
- Reduces chunk timeout to a more reasonable duration
- Implements retry logic for network failures

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a standardized lazy loading utility
- Audit all components for lazy loading candidates
- Implement progressive loading for large components
- Optimize code splitting configuration in Webpack
- Add intelligent preloading for likely user paths
- Create reusable loading states for different component types
- Implement error boundaries with retry capabilities
- Add analytics to monitor loading performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- Initial page load time reduced by at least 30%
- Core Web Vitals scores improved (LCP, CLS, FID)
- All non-essential components use standardized lazy loading
- Loading states displayed for components taking >300ms to load
- Error boundaries properly handle chunk loading failures
- Analytics show reduced component loading failures
- Mobile devices show measurable performance improvements
- No visible layout shifts during component loading

## Additional Notes

Pay special attention to mobile performance, as lazy loading benefits are even more significant on slower connections and devices with limited resources.
