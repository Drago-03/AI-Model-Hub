# Issue: Implement Comprehensive Automated Testing Framework

**Tags:** `testing`, `quality-assurance`, `frontend`, `backend`, `high-priority`

## Description

The current codebase lacks adequate test coverage, with inconsistent testing approaches and many untested components. This leads to frequent regressions and makes it difficult to confidently make changes. We need to implement a comprehensive automated testing framework covering unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Low test coverage across the codebase
- Inconsistent testing approaches and patterns
- Many core features lack tests entirely
- No integration tests for critical workflows
- Missing end-to-end tests for user journeys
- No visual regression testing
- Tests are often skipped during development
- No performance or load testing
- Poor test maintainability leading to flaky tests
- No standardized mocking approach

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive testing framework that:
- Increases test coverage across the codebase
- Standardizes testing approaches and patterns
- Ensures all core features have appropriate tests
- Adds integration tests for critical workflows
- Implements end-to-end tests for key user journeys
- Adds visual regression testing
- Makes testing an integral part of development
- Includes performance and load testing
- Improves test maintainability
- Standardizes mocking and test data generation

## Implementation Requirements

- Define testing standards and patterns for different types of tests
- Set up unit testing framework with appropriate tools
- Implement integration testing for service interactions
- Create end-to-end testing suite for key user journeys
- Set up visual regression testing
- Integrate testing into the development workflow
- Implement performance and load testing
- Create utilities for test maintainability
- Standardize mocking and test data generation
- Provide developer training on testing best practices

## Acceptance Criteria

- Test coverage increased to at least 80% for critical code paths
- All new code includes appropriate tests
- Integration tests verify correct service interactions
- End-to-end tests cover all critical user journeys
- Visual changes are caught by visual regression tests
- CI pipeline runs all tests automatically
- Performance and load tests ensure system meets requirements
- Tests are maintainable and rarely flaky
- Mocking is consistent and easy to implement
- Developers follow testing best practices

## Additional Notes

This initiative should be implemented incrementally, focusing first on critical features and high-risk areas. Consider adopting a test-driven development approach for new features to build a culture of testing.
