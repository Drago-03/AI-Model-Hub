# Issue: Improve Application Error Handling and Resilience

**Tags:** `reliability`, `error-handling`, `frontend`, `backend`, `high-priority`

## Description

The current application lacks a comprehensive error handling strategy, leading to poor user experience when errors occur and making it difficult to diagnose and fix issues. We need to implement robust error handling and resilience patterns to improve reliability and user experience.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Inconsistent error handling across different parts of the application
- Many unhandled exceptions that cause application crashes
- Generic error messages that don't help users resolve issues
- Missing fallback states for components when data loading fails
- No retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Poor logging of errors, making debugging difficult
- No offline support or degraded functionality when network is unavailable
- Lack of graceful degradation when services are down
- No error boundary implementation in React components
- Database and API failures not handled consistently

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive error handling strategy that:
- Standardizes error handling across the application
- Provides helpful error messages to users
- Implements fallback states for failed components
- Adds retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Enhances error logging and monitoring
- Adds offline support where feasible
- Implements graceful degradation
- Uses error boundaries to prevent cascading failures
- Handles database and API failures consistently

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a centralized error handling service
- Implement error boundaries around key components
- Add fallback UI states for loading failures
- Create retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Enhance error logging with contextual information
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for external services
- Add offline capabilities where appropriate
- Create graceful degradation strategies for service outages
- Standardize database and API error handling
- Add error analytics to track and prioritize issues

## Acceptance Criteria

- No unhandled exceptions in the application
- All errors provide clear, actionable messages to users
- Components display appropriate fallback UI when failures occur
- Transient failures are automatically retried with appropriate backoff
- All errors are properly logged with context for debugging
- Application functions in a degraded state when offline
- Services gracefully degrade when dependencies are unavailable
- Error boundaries prevent entire application crashes
- Database and API errors are handled consistently
- Error analytics provide insight into most common issues

## Additional Notes

This enhancement should be implemented iteratively, starting with the most critical parts of the application. Consider implementing chaos engineering practices to test resilience under failure conditions.
