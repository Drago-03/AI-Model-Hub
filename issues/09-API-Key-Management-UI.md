# Issue: Enhance API Key Management User Interface

**Tags:** `frontend`, `user-experience`, `medium-priority`, `api`, `security`

## Description

The current API key management interface lacks important features and usability enhancements that would improve the developer experience. We need a more comprehensive UI that provides better visibility, control, and security for API keys.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Limited visibility into API key usage and activity
- No filtering or sorting options for multiple API keys
- Missing ability to set custom permissions per key
- No visual indicators for key status (active, expired, etc.)
- Limited key naming and organization options
- No usage statistics per API key
- Missing audit log for key creation and usage
- Poor mobile responsiveness of the current UI

## Proposed Solution

Implement an enhanced API key management interface that:
- Provides detailed usage statistics for each key
- Offers filtering and sorting options
- Supports custom permission scopes per key
- Includes clear visual status indicators
- Allows better organization and naming
- Shows comprehensive audit logs
- Works well on all device sizes

## Implementation Requirements

- Redesign the API key management UI
- Implement usage statistics tracking per key
- Add filtering and sorting functionality
- Create a permission scope selection interface
- Implement visual status indicators
- Add audit logging for key events
- Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes
- Add confirmation flows for sensitive operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can view detailed usage statistics for each API key
- Keys can be filtered and sorted by various attributes
- Custom permission scopes can be set for each key
- Visual indicators clearly show key status
- Keys can be organized with custom names and descriptions
- Audit logs show key creation, usage, and changes
- Interface works well on mobile devices
- Sensitive operations require confirmation

## Additional Notes

The design should prioritize security while maintaining usability. Consider implementing features like automatic key rotation reminders and security best practices guidance directly in the UI.
