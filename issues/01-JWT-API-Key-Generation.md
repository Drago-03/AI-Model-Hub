# Issue: Implement JWT-based API Key Generation System

**Tags:** `feature-request`, `security`, `backend`, `high-priority`, `api`

## Description

The current API key generation system uses basic string manipulation and lacks modern security standards. We need a JWT-based API key generation system that provides enhanced security, payload validation, and expiration mechanisms.

## Current Implementation Issues

- API keys are currently generated using basic random bytes
- No cryptographic signing to verify key authenticity
- Limited support for claims and metadata in the key itself
- No standardized approach for key validation
- Keys cannot contain structured data about permissions
- Manual expiration handling instead of using built-in JWT features
- No rotation policy enforcement

## Proposed Solution

Implement a JWT-based API key generation system with:
- Proper key signing using RS256 or similar algorithms
- Structured claims for permissions and metadata
- Built-in expiration handling
- Key rotation policies
- Revocation mechanisms

## Implementation Requirements

- Create a JWT token generation service
- Implement proper secret key management
- Create validation middleware for JWT-based API keys
- Add support for scoped permissions in the token payload
- Develop a key rotation and revocation system
- Update all API endpoints to use the new JWT verification
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing API keys

## Acceptance Criteria

- JWT-based API keys can be generated with configurable expiration
- Keys contain properly encoded claims for user ID, permissions, and metadata
- All API requests are properly authenticated with the new JWT system
- Invalid or expired tokens are rejected
- Key revocation works immediately across all services
- Performance impact of JWT validation is minimal

## Additional Notes

This change should be implemented with minimal disruption to existing users, potentially with a phased rollout strategy to migrate from the current system.
