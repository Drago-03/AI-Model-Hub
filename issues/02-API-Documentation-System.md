# Issue: Comprehensive API Documentation System

**Tags:** `documentation`, `developer-experience`, `medium-priority`, `api`

## Description

Current API documentation is fragmented across multiple files and lacks a standardized approach. We need a comprehensive, auto-generated API documentation system that stays in sync with the actual codebase.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Documentation spread across multiple locations (app/api-docs, app/docs, DOCUMENTATION.md)
- No automated generation from code comments or schemas
- Inconsistent formatting and structure across endpoints
- Missing examples for many API endpoints
- No versioning information in the documentation
- Limited search functionality for developers
- No interactive testing capabilities

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive API documentation system that:
- Auto-generates docs from code comments and type definitions
- Provides a consistent format for all endpoints
- Includes interactive testing capabilities
- Offers versioning support
- Features a powerful search system

## Implementation Requirements

- Choose an API documentation framework (Swagger/OpenAPI, ReDoc, etc.)
- Implement standardized JSDoc or similar comments for all API endpoints
- Create a documentation build process as part of CI/CD
- Design a user-friendly documentation UI
- Add an interactive API testing console
- Implement search functionality
- Include versioning information

## Acceptance Criteria

- All API endpoints are documented with consistent format
- Documentation is automatically generated from the codebase
- Examples are provided for request/response of each endpoint
- Interactive testing console allows developers to make API calls
- Search functionality helps find specific endpoints
- Documentation is versioned to match API versions
- Authentication requirements are clearly documented

## Additional Notes

This documentation system should be designed with both internal developers and external API consumers in mind. It should serve as a complete reference for all API capabilities.
