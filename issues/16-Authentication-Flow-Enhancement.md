# Issue: Enhance Authentication Flow and Security

**Tags:** `security`, `authentication`, `frontend`, `backend`, `high-priority`

## Description

The current authentication system has several usability and security issues. It lacks proper session management, has an incomplete implementation of multi-factor authentication, and doesn't provide sufficient security for password reset flows. The authentication UI also has inconsistent styling and behavior across different parts of the application.

## Current Implementation Issues

- Incomplete multi-factor authentication implementation
- Password reset flow lacks proper expiration and validation
- Google OAuth integration creates duplicate accounts in some cases
- Session timeout handling is inconsistent
- No support for passwordless authentication options
- Authentication errors lack clear user guidance
- Token refresh mechanism fails in certain edge cases
- No account recovery options beyond email
- Sign-up form validation is inconsistent
- Authentication state management is inefficient

## Proposed Solution

Implement a comprehensive authentication enhancement that:
- Completes multi-factor authentication implementation
- Improves password reset security and usability
- Fixes OAuth integration issues
- Standardizes session management
- Adds passwordless authentication options
- Improves error handling and user guidance
- Enhances token refresh mechanism
- Provides additional account recovery options
- Standardizes form validation
- Optimizes authentication state management

## Implementation Requirements

- Complete the MFA implementation with multiple options (SMS, authenticator app)
- Redesign password reset flow with proper expiration and security
- Fix Google OAuth account linking and duplicate prevention
- Implement consistent session timeout handling and notifications
- Add support for magic link and/or WebAuthn authentication
- Create standardized authentication error messages with clear user guidance
- Improve token refresh to handle all edge cases
- Add alternative account recovery methods
- Standardize form validation across all authentication forms
- Optimize authentication state management in frontend

## Acceptance Criteria

- MFA works seamlessly with multiple second-factor options
- Password reset links expire appropriately and are secure
- No duplicate accounts are created during OAuth sign-in
- Users are properly notified before session expiration
- Passwordless authentication options are available
- Authentication errors provide clear guidance to users
- Token refresh works reliably in all tested scenarios
- Users have multiple options for account recovery
- All authentication forms have consistent validation
- Authentication state management is optimized for performance

## Additional Notes

Security enhancements should be carefully tested to ensure they don't introduce new vulnerabilities. Consider implementing a staged rollout of new authentication features to minimize disruption to existing users.
